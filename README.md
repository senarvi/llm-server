# LLM server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech). It uses the
[Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of aiohttp.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m llm_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

The OpenAPI definition can be found here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use pytest:
```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest tests -v
```

## Prevent file overriding

After first generation, add edited files to _.openapi-generator-ignore_ to prevent generator from overwriting them. Typically:
```
server/controllers/*
test/*
*.txt
```
