        "intelligence and consciousness. In general Garland is able to build an interesting atmosphere and the "
        "cinematography is excellent. However, I found that the movie is a bit too slow in the beginning and the "
        "characters are only explored at surface level, which personally left me wanting for a bit more. The issues "
        "the movie tackles are also quite simplified, possibly to make the film a bit more digestible, but I "
